# Project Overview
This project is developed using Python 3.x in a Jupyter Notebook extension within Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, and building machine learning models. The key steps include data manipulation, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- numpy: For numerical computations.
- datetime: For handling date and time operations.
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- scikit-learn (sklearn): For machine learning tasks, including preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
> StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder: For data preprocessing.  
> train_test_split: For splitting data into training and testing sets.  
> LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier: For building machine learning models.  
> accuracy_score, f1_score: For model evaluation.  
> make_column_transformer, SimpleImputer, make_pipeline: For constructing data preprocessing pipelines.  
> GridSearchCV: For hyperparameter tuning.  
- matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
